Twitter like app exercise called "Glitter" - (littering the internet? don't ask!)

The purpose of this excercise (so I've been told) is to create a "Twitter" like client to demonstrate how one should handle
asynchronus comms, error handling, using the SQLite db, handling UI elements with fragments, animations,
listeners, how unit tests can be developed for such a thing, etc...

Notes:
- Only one user has been added to the database (see the LitterDBHandler.java file for details or to change). The app will default fill in these values upon launch
uername: kyloren@emo-sith.com
password: password
- Some "Litters" are pre-populted, more can be added
- A bad email or password will show a failure case fragment
- Limitations and TODO's are explained in the code

Development time for code, graphics, testing and documenting: Aprox 16 hours (So it's lacking! Be kind!) :)
